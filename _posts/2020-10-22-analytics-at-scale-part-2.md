## Specification and Instrumentation
<br />



In our last post, we discussed the need of having a unified framework for analytics. In order for a company to make data informed decisions, the underlying data infrastructure must be built first.

The process of building the right data infrastructure involves a multi step process. We’ll talk briefly about the first step which is Specification and Instrumentation.

To measure the behaviour of users, we can look at data right down to the fundamentals elements - Events and their respective properties.

Events are actions that a user performs when accessing your website. Examples include visiting the landing page, adding an item to the cart etc. A single user can generate multiple events but which events should you track?

A tracking plan becomes crucial to specify when events to track and describe how an event looks like. Once you have a tracking plan in place, how do you implement the tracking process? 

Customer Data Platforms like Segment can provide great value in terms of the Specification and Instrumentation needs. In the following post we’ll dive deep into what Customer Data Platforms are and how Segment fits into our unified Analytics framework.
