## An Introduction
<br />



The current trend in the Startup world is to be Data Driven. Tracking metrics which are actionable is immensely important as Startups need to find a way to the right product before the VC money runs out.

There are a plethora of data tools available to us, these products cater to different needs of the Analytical life cycle of a company. These needs can be classified to Product Analytics/Data Integration/Data Warehousing.

While we do have a number of tools in the Data ecosystem, what we lack is a unifying framework to allow for end to end analytics right from building the underlying data infrastructure to building dashboards on a BI (read what BI is all about here) tool.

Gleb Mezhanksy, on the DataFold [blog](https://www.datafold.com/blog/dream-stack-for-analytics/) has presented his ideas around a unifying framework for analytics.

In this series, we are going to dive deep into the concepts presented within Glebâ€™s framework by applying Analytics on our hypothetical ecommerce company Digiteria Inc.

Stay tuned for the next parts in the series!
